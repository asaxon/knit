- system_program
    - transfer() [instruction_handler NOT instructions]
- memo_program
    - memo() [instruction_handler NOT instructions]
- funfact -> lighthouse protocol -> has instruction_handler which checks your SOL balance TODO: read this [code](https://github.com/Jac0xb/lighthouse)
- token mint addresses
- token_program
    - transfer() [instruction_handler NOT instructions]
- program derived address (key/value store solana includes it)
    - not on the cryptography curves
        - AKA offchain
    - bunch of different types, strings, addresses, etc
    - buildATA() [instruction_handler]
- lots more programs but ALL HAVE
    - address and instruction_handlers
    - look closely, some pubkeys of programs are cute bc you can keep making keypairs til you get one you like lmfao
- storing data
    - bit more interesting than sending tokens around
    - create_movie_program
        - addReview()
            - str "titanic"
        - program derived address
            - content, rating
- solana program frameworks (anchor, poseidon)
    - follow turbine for TS beta
- summary: people
    - everyone has keypair
    - pubkey === address
    - privkey === signing
        - YOU CAN USE SAME KEYPAIR ACROSS DIFFERENT NETWORKS BUT MAKE SURE YOU'RE POINTING TO DEVNET DUMMY
- summary: programs
    - programs deployed to an address
    - programs have f(x)s called instruction_handlers inside --> data is stored seperately
    - transactions include instructions for different program's instruction handlers
- summary: data items
    - programs store data items in program derived addresses
    - PDAs are created from inputs - the same inputs always return the same adress!
